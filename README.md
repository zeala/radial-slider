> **Few comments:**

> - This application is build with Typescript, React, ScSS and Webpack.
> - I built this application using CSS, mainly because I wanted to see how many overlapping interactive features will behave in different browers. Alternatively, this could have been build using SVG (which was my original preferred option) or event Canvas.
> - There are still some unfinished bits that I might revisit.
